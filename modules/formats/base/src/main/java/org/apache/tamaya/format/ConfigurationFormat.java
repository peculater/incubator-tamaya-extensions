 * of different priorities. In this cases, each ordinal type found typically is returned as a separate section so the

 * individual {@link org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySource}s.</p>

     * the capabilities of the format the returned {@link org.apache.tamaya.format.ConfigurationData} may contain
     * different levels of data:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Only a <i>default</i> section is returned, since the configuration format does not support
     *     hierarchies. This is the case for properties and xml properties.</li>
     *     <li>Hierarchical formats such as INI, XML and JSON can map each node to a section. Each section
     *     can have its own key/value pairs. This allows to map also complex formats in a generic way. A
     *     format implementation should then additionally flatten the whole data and store it in a accessible as
     *     {@link ConfigurationData#getCombinedProperties()}. This allows to use the properties as inout to a default mapping,
     *     which is always appropriate as long as no other semnatics
     *     are defined in the concrete target scenario.</li>
     *     <li>More complex custom scenarios should map their configuration data read into different
     *     sections. Typically the data will be mapped into different {@link org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySource}
     *     instances with different ordinal levels. As an example imagine a custom format that contains sections
     *     'defaults', 'global-defaults', 'application', 'server-overrides'.</li>
     *     <li>Alternate formats</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Summarizing implementations common formats should always provide
     * <ul>
     *     <li>the data organized in sections as useful for the given format. If data is organized in one section, it
     *     should be mapped into the DEFAULT section.</li>
     *     <li>Formats that do provide multiple sections, should always provide a FLATTENED section as well, where
     *     all the data is organized as a flattened key/value pairs, enabling a generic mapping to a
     *     {@link org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySource}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * If the configuration format only contains entries of one ordinal type, normally only one single
     * instance of PropertySource is returned (the corresponding key/values should end up in the DEFAULT section).
     * Nevertheless custom formats may contain different sections or parts,
     * where each part maps to a different target ordinal (eg defaults, domain config and app config). In the
     * ladder case multiple PropertySources can be returned, each one with its own ordinal and the corresponding
     * entries.
     * @see org.apache.tamaya.spi.PropertySource
     * @param inputStream the inputStream to read from, not null.
     * @param resource the resource id, not null.
     * @return the corresponding {@link ConfigurationData} containing sections/properties read, never {@code null}.

     * @throws IOException if reading the input fails.
